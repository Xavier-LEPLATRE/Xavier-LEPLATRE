I'm a **Fullstack JavaScript Web Developper** with affinity about **Graphism & Design** and passionate in Tech & UI/UX.

### About me

Before to become a web developper, I'm working for 11 years in risk prevention in nuclear center. I begin developpement with VBA on excel but I'm not interesting on.
I follow a **fullstack web developper** session at **O'Clock School**. It was a very hard session of 6 month to learn more about web developpement but it was the most
enriching experience in my life. For the first time, I did what I really want to do for professional career.
